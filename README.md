# TeXmacs Docker image

This repository contains a workflow to generate a Docker image with an installation of TeXmacs.
Suitable for continuous development. 

Based on `Debian Bookworm` (for the AMD64 architecture), with `git` and `TeXmacs 2.1.4` preinstalled and a lot of other stuff (required by the TeXmacs package).
See [./Dockerfile] for the precise recipe.

PR & suggestions for improvement are welcome!
